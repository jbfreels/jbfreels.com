For the last couple years I've been wanting to write more and collect some of 
my knowledge into one location.  I currently have a couple dozen gists, random 
notes on my phone, desktop txt files, etc.  

Hopefully I can come up with a routine to update this site on a regular basis 
with semi-coherent ramblings, tips, and tutorials.
