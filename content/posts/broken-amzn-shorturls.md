Amazon broke the shortlink URL convention I was using for my reading lists.  I like using the shorter/cleaner URL to keep my markdown easier to read.  

Old short URL...

`https://amzon.com/`

Now I have to use...

`https://www.amazon.com/dp/`

I wonder if they know they broke it, or repurposed for something else, forwards to `https://arcus-www.amazon.com` and the product codes in the URL don't take you to valid product pages. 

The new way is still better than using the full product URL.  Let me know if there is another system you use for Amazon links.
