# Happy Valentine's Day
My mother-in-law gifted me [the Mindful Life Journal](https://amzn.com/1948337002) for Valentine's Day.  Very thoughtful and I'm pretty excited to have it.  A couple years ago I started a Google doc to write in every day.  It looks something like this...

I forget now where I got my "rules" from, but they are fairly generic and probably pulled them together from a few different YouTube videos about bettering yourself as well as a couple books.  As you can see from the outline, I didn't get to writing every day.  Not through my own experience, yet(!), but I've heard you shouldn't use a digital medium for your daily mindful writing.  A physical notebook or journal is best.  

Guess we can now put this to the test.  Though I do believe having a physical book in an area I frequent will definitely benefit my daily writing.  

Tomorrow starts day one.

## Update March 1st, 2020
I've only missed one full day so far. The journal does have me do an entry at night and I'm not very fond of it. It asks you to reflect on the bad of the day and I don't really like that so I don't feel bad about missing nights. Maybe I should just skip that part.
