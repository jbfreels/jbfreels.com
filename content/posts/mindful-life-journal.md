# Happy Valentine's Day
My mother-in-law gifted me [the Mindful Life Journal](https://amzn.com/1948337002) for Valentine's Day.  Very thoughtful and I'm pretty excited to have it.  A couple years ago I started a Google doc to write in every day.  It looks something like this...

I forget now where I got my "rules" from, but they are fairly generic and probably pulled them together from a few different YouTube videos about bettering yourself as well as a couple books.  As you can see from the outline, I didn't get to writing every day.  Not through my own experience, yet(!), but I've heard you shouldn't use a digital medium for your daily mindful writing.  A physical notebook or journal is best.  

Guess we can now put this to the test.  Though I do believe having a physical book in an area I frequent will definitely benefit my daily writing.  

Tomorrow starts day one.
