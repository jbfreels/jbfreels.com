# Storytime
This weekend I got to spend some time with my daughter.  I've been super busy 
with work so it was a nice treat.  We had decided while we were out to go 
to McDonald's to try their new spicy chicken nuggets. We order our food, which 
was a little difficult being that we're still in the middle of a pandemic.  It 
was also super busy, lunch rush on a Saturday. I noticed after placing our 
order and paying that the order was incorrect.  My daughter had ordered a #6 
(nugs meal) but spicy nuggets instead of the regular nuggets.  It was rung up 
as a #7 (filet-o-fish meal) plus an order of spicy nuggets.  

I notify the cashier of the issue.  He calls over a manager for a refund 
and explains the issue.  The manager looks at the sign and says 
"There's only a 10 cent difference, I'm not refunding that." and then 
proceeds to walk away.  Obviously, he didn't understand the problem.  I 
call out "hey, you're not listening to him" and the manager turns around and 
I explain the issue to him.  This guy is expediting, so he was in a hurry to 
get back to fulfilling orders.  He huffs and then approves a refund of the extra 
chicken nuggets.  I'm still out that dime, but whatever.

He turns around to go back to doing what he was doing and I hear him say, 
"douchebag".  

The rest of the story isn't interesting.  Nothing YouTube worthy 
happened, I just stared him down and he was a little bitch.

It wasn't until the next day though that I realized that I've always 
felt safe in a McDonald's.  I mean going into one in a shady part 
of town is a little different.  I remember once as a teenager, 
McDonald's in downtown Milwaukee.  The Atlanta Grady McDonald's is 
a little sketch as well, but I didn't fear the employees or felt 
McDonald's was making an unsafe environment.  

Sounds like I might be the bitch now, but I grew up with McDonald's, 
as did most everyone else.  My generation had a deeper connection 
with the experience though, I feel.  There's not a time that I don't 
remember McDonald's, and my family has stories from before I was 
even born that are still told during the holidays.  

When I was 6...7...8...probably every year previous to becoming a 
teenager, I had some birthday's at McDonald's, or I'd attend parties at 
McDonald's.  What happened to parties at McDonald's? 
It use to be a throw-down.  Fuckin' Grimace or Ronald showing up, 
trays of fries and burgers, play-place.  And it cost the parents 
very little.  

Nowadays (oof), kids have parties at those jump gyms, Andretti, 
Adventure Air Sports, lazer golf (wtf even), lazer tag.  

Adult parties have gone the same way.  Fuckin' axe throwing, 
escape rooms, skydiving...

What the fuck happened to just hanging out and celebrating?  
Now it has to be this structured event of "be here at 3PM, don't 
be late or we'll still be charged", "cake at 4", "quick present 
opening because we have to be out of there at 5".  

McDonald's, host my next birthday party and we'll call it even.  

```
It must be at this location:

3010 CANTON RD
MARIETTA, GA 30066
```
I want the manager dressed as the Hamburglar.  

# McUpdate
I was contacted by corporate as well as the franchise owner. 
They sent me some swanky cards for free meals.  While I was hoping for a birthday party or a gift-card for $0.10, this will 
do.  They are only good for the McDonald's with the issue and a 
few other locations, but they are not convenient.  I think I'll 
go see what my favorite manager is up to this weekend, might have 
to see if he's been given proper training as well...
