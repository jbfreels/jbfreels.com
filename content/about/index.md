# Welcome to my personal blog
I'm an Atlanta, GA based software professional with over 20 years experience developing innovative software solutions to meet customers' needs.  Ever since high-school I've tinkered with different hardware, operating systems, and software.  Always striving to find a better and more efficient way to work and play.  

I'm currently spending as much time as I can with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for work and personal use.  I migrated this website from a host I've had (still have!) since high-school, [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?89813) (affiliate link, [non-affiliate link](https://www.dreamhost.com/)).  DreamHost offers a lot of options and competitive pricing, but I think I'll benefit the most from all the different technologies AWS offers.  

This site utilizes...
* [s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - Stores website static data.
* [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) - CDN, delivering the website from s3.
* [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) - Uses lambda to translate URLs for CloudFront.
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - Push website to s3 as well as invalidate the CDN.
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Static site generator that made this website.

## Interests
Of course all-things-tech (3D printing, VR, PC building, IoT) are at the top of my interests list, but outside of that I enjoy reading (check out my [reading lists](/categories/reading/)), cruising, cooking, yard work, and small engines.  I've got two great kids (5 & 19).
